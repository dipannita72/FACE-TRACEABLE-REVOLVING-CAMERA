The objectives of building this project are to eliminate the need for a third party cameraman and to fully automate the process of video recording. The entire recording procedure can be done by a single person. This is especially useful under circumstances where a cameraman cannot be afforded or cases where maintaining user privacy is crucial. 

We programmed a raspberry pi, placed on an arrangement of a DC motor to detect faces in real-time from a video recording, recorded by a Picamera. The chosen face will be tracked by the pi and the motor will be rotated according to the movement of the face, thereby maintaining the position of the face within a certain range of the camera view. The video recorded by the Picamera will be streamed live to a web server which will be accessible by all users
